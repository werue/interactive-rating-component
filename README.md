## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to style radio buttons. I used the adjacent sibling selector to style the label next to a checked radio button. I also learned how to use javaScript to toggle classes. In this project, I toggled a "hidden" class between the rating state and thank you state.

### Continued development

I haven't learned enough about Asynchronous JavaScript to make smooth transitions between the rating state and thank you state. I hope to further my knowledge and come back to accomplish that.
